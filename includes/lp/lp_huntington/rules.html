                <p>Non-winning entries will not carry over into the drawings for subsequent Entry Periods, but may be eligible for any Alternate Drawing. &nbsp;Administrator also will randomly select one (1) potential Grand Prize winner from among all eligible entries received during the Promotion Period, on or around August 10, 2010.&nbsp; The potential winners will be notified by email, mail or phone.&nbsp; Each potential First Prize winner who entered using a Debit Card may be required to respond to a notification from Administrator or Sponsor within ten (10) days of the date notice or attempted notice is sent or given, providing a full mailing address (P.O. Boxes are not permitted), an Affidavit, an IRS Form W-9 and/or other information in order to claim the prize.&nbsp; Potential Grand Prize winner (parent/legal guardian if winner is a minor in his/her state of residence) will be required to sign and return an Affidavit of Eligibility, Liability &amp; Publicity Release (&quot;Affidavit&quot;), which must be received by Administrator within ten (10) days of the date notice or attempted notice is sent, or other information in order to claim the prize.&nbsp; If a potential winner cannot be contacted, fails to respond (for First Prizes) or to sign and return the Affidavit and/or other documents requested by the Administrator or the Sponsor (for Grand Prize winner and for any First Prize winner for which tax reporting is necessary because total prize value exceeds $600) within the required time period, potential winner forfeits the applicable prize.&nbsp; Potential winners must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of these Official Rules, and winning is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements.&nbsp; In the event that a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, Sponsor will award the applicable prize to an alternate winner by random drawing (each, an &ldquo;Alternate Drawing&rdquo;) from among all remaining eligible entries.&nbsp; Only three (3) Alternate Drawings will be held, after which the applicable prize will remain un-awarded.&nbsp; Prizes will be fulfilled approximately 8-10 weeks after winner confirmation.&nbsp; </p>

Sponsor reserves the right to substitute a prize for one of equal or greater value if the designated prize should become unavailable for any reason.&nbsp; Winners are responsible for all taxes and fees associated with prize receipt and/or use.&nbsp; A winner may receive an IRS Form 1099-MISC after the end of the calendar year and a copy of any such form will be filed with the IRS.&nbsp; Odds of winning a prize depend on the number of eligible entries received during each Entry Period and the entire Promotion Period.&nbsp; Limit: One (1) First Prize per person per daily Entry Period.&nbsp; Total ARV of all prizes: $100,000.</p>
                <p><strong>7. Release:</strong> By receipt of any prize, winner agrees to release and hold harmless Sponsor, Arnold Worldwide, Administrator, and their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, suppliers, distributors, advertising/promotion agencies, and prize suppliers, and each of their respective parent companies and each such company&rsquo;s officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the &ldquo;Released Parties&rdquo;) from and against any claim or cause of action, including, but not limited to, personal injury, death, or damage to or loss of property, arising out of participation in the Sweepstakes or receipt or use<strong> </strong>or misuse of any prize. </p>
                <p><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Publicity:</strong> Except where prohibited, participation in the Sweepstakes constitutes winner&rsquo;s consent to Sponsor&rsquo;s and its agents&rsquo; use of winner&rsquo;s name, prize, likeness, photograph, voice, opinions and/or hometown and state for promotional purposes in any media, worldwide, without further payment or consideration. </p>
                <p><strong>9.</strong> <strong>General Conditions:</strong> Sponsor reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify the Sweepstakes, or any part of it, if any fraud, technical failures or any other factor beyond Sponsor&rsquo;s reasonable control impairs the integrity or proper functioning of the Sweepstakes, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion.&nbsp; Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify any person it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Sweepstakes or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or any other promotion or in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner.&nbsp; Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Sweepstakes may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law.&nbsp; Sponsor&rsquo;s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. </p>
                <p><strong>10.</strong> <strong>Limitations of Liability:</strong> The Released Parties are not responsible for: (1) any incorrect or inaccurate information, whether caused by entrants, printing errors or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Sweepstakes; (2) technical failures of any kind, including, but not limited to malfunctions, interruptions, or disconnections in phone lines or network hardware or software; (3) unauthorized human intervention in any part of the entry process or the Sweepstakes; (4) technical or human error which may occur in the administration of the Sweepstakes or the processing of entries; (5) late, lost, undeliverable, damaged, postage-due or stolen mail; or (6) any injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from entrant&rsquo;s participation in the Sweepstakes or receipt or use<strong> </strong>or misuse of any prize.&nbsp; If for any reason an entrant's entry is confirmed to have been erroneously deleted, lost, or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, entrant&rsquo;s sole remedy is another entry in the Sweepstakes, provided that, if it is not possible to award another entry due to discontinuance of the Sweepstakes, or any part of it, for any reason, Sponsor, in its sole discretion, may elect to hold a random drawing from among all eligible entries received up to the date of discontinuance for any or all of the prizes offered herein.&nbsp; No more than the stated number of prizes will be awarded.&nbsp; In the event that production, technical, seeding, programming or any other reasons cause more than the stated number of prizes as set forth in these Official Rules to be available and/or claimed, Sponsor reserves the right to award only the stated number of prizes by a random drawing among all legitimate, un-awarded, eligible prize claims.</p>
                <p><strong>11. Disputes:</strong> Except where prohibited, entrant agrees that: (1) any and all disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of or connected with this Sweepstakes or any prize awarded shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action, and exclusively by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (Southern Division) or the appropriate Michigan State Court located in Oakland County, Michigan; (2) any and all claims, judgments and awards shall be limited to actual out-of-pocket costs incurred, including costs associated with entering this Sweepstakes, but in no event attorneys&rsquo; fees; and (3) under no circumstances will entrant be permitted to obtain awards for, and entrant hereby waives all rights to claim, indirect, punitive, incidental and consequential damages and any other damages, other than for actual out-of-pocket expenses, and any and all rights to have damages multiplied or otherwise increased.&nbsp; All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of these Official Rules, or the rights and obligations of the entrant and Sponsor in connection with the Sweepstakes, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Michigan without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules (whether of the State of Michigan or any other jurisdiction), which would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Michigan. </p>
